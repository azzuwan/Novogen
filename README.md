AppGen
==================

Description
------------------
An database application generator that scaffold a fully functioning application with CRUD pages and JSON API end points.

This is a database first development approach. The generator is supposed to figure out the database structure and create all the necessary user interface for it plus a rich set of JSON APis.

Tools used:

- Java 8
- Apache MetaModel - An excellent all persistent type meta query interface [http://metamodel.apache.org/](http://metamodel.apache.org/ "http://metamodel.apache.org/")
- Rapidoid - An Awesome Java Microframework. It is actually  quite a full featured framework.


Goals
------------------
- To be able to generate a basic SparkJava web application
- (LATER) Generic enough to allow generation for frameworks in other languages like Iris (Go), Laravel (PHP) through the usage of a framework template engine
